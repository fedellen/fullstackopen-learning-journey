# Fullstack Open Learning Journey

Here is a compilation of projects I've created while following along with the course material located at [Fullstack Open](https://https://fullstackopen.com/).

## Main Technologies

- React
- Express
- Redux
- MongoDB
- GraphQL
- Apollo Server/Client

I've learned a tremendous amount about web development from this course. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in modern development using Javascript and React.
