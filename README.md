# Fullstack Open Learning Journey ðŸš€

Here is a compilation of projects I've created while following along with the course material located at [Fullstack Open](https://https://fullstackopen.com/). Projects marked with `**-practice` were made following the material directly. The others were made to solve the `exercise` portions of the course.

Many of these are smaller projects for learning a particular concept or technology. Some were re-visted during the course and developed into larger applications.

I've learned a tremendous amount about web development from this course. The exercises were challenging and really drove my programming skills to a new level. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in modern development using JavaScript and React ðŸ’»
